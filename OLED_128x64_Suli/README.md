LED 128×64 Display module is an OLED monochrome 128×64dot matrix display module with Grove 4pin I2C Interface.Comparing to LCD, OLED screens are way more competitive, which has a number of advantages such as high brightness, self-emission, high contrast ratio, slim / thin outline, wide viewing angle, wide temperature range, and low power consumption. It has bigger screen so that it can display more contents than the OLED 96×96.

***For Arduino:***

Just like you use the other Library, What's different is you should download Suli for Arduino First, remember that just put Suli for Arduino to your Arduino libraries folder.
